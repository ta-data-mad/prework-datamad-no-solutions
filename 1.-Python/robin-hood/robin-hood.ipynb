    "We are in a competition to win the archery contest in Sherwood. With our bow and arrows we shoot on a target and try to hit as close as possible to the center.\n",

    "## Description:\n",
    "In the 2-dimensional space, a point can be defined by a pair of values that correspond to the horizontal coordinate (x) and the vertical coordinate (y). The space can be divided into 4 zones (quadrants): Q1, Q2, Q3, Q4. Whose single point of union is the point (0, 0).\n",
    "\n",
    "If a point is in Q1 both its x coordinate and the y are positive. I leave a link to wikipedia to familiarize yourself with these quadrants.\n",

    "4. If the target has a radius of 9, calculate the number of arrows that must be picked up in the forest."
